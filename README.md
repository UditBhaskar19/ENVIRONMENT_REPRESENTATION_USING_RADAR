# Radar Based Perception Projects
This repository contains Object Tracking and Environment Modelling Projects. These are applicable in domains like **robotic perception**, **autonomous driving** and **advance driver assistance system applications**. These projects are ongoing, and several other might be added and the existing ones might be enhanced in the future.
